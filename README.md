## Introduction
Cell division is an essential, conserved process. In animal cells, centro- somes are a major microtubule organizing center. The position of the centrosomes inside the cell is important for correct cell division and thus is tightly regulated. Theoretical models based on the forces generated along the microtubules have accounted for the dynamic movements of the centrosomes during cell division but often adopted inconsistent assumptions to explain successive movements, thus preventing a unified model for centrosome positioning. Previous models assumed weak cortical attachment of astral microtubules for nuclear centration but strong attachment for spindle elongation in the one-cell-stage embryo. Here, we mathematically analyzed these processes at steady state and validated our unified model with experimental results from nematode and sea urchin embryos whose shape we manipulated. Our results suggest that the attachment strength does switch between processes in both species, and models of cell division should account for this feature.
